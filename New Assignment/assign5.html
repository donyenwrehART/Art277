        <p>
          Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those
          most at-risk to COVID-19: senior citizens, the immune compromised, and
          people with pre-existing medical conditions which put them at
          additional risk.
          <br />
          <br />
          Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries,
          medicine, and other necessary supplies to empower everyone to stay
          healthy and be as responsible as they can be.

          Helping Hands Community connects those who must shelter in place with
          our volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and
          essential supplies get delivered safely.

          <br />
          <br />

          Our technology platform makes community volunteerism easy and reliable
          while providing an intuitive solution for partners to scale their own
          impact.
          <br />
          <br />

          Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch
          requests at scale through the Helping Hands Community platform, while
          we connect individuals who need help and can offer help through our
          website.
