        <h2>Mission</h2>
        Our mission is to serve individuals at risk for COVID-19 and food
        insecurity, using technology to empower community organizations and
        local volunteers to deliver the essential supplies to those in need.

          <h2>How we help</h2>
          <p>
            Lemme Help connects those who must shelter in place with our
            volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and
            essential supplies get delivered safely.

            <img src="man.jpg" alt="This is a man" class="man" />
            Our technology platform makes community volunteerism easy and
            reliable while providing an intuitive solution for partners to scale
            their own impact.
            <br />
            <br />

            Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and
            batch requests at scale through the Lemme Help platform, while we
            connect individuals who need help and can offer help through our
            website.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our partnerships with organizations like Wider Circle, Optum, Second
            Harvest, Uber and others have allowed us to help bridge volunteer
            shortages and solve the challenge of last mile delivery at scale.
            We've grown the number of people we can help by working together—and
            we are always open to new partners who want to contribute to our
            mission.
