    <h1><strong>Travelling in Depression</strong></h1>

    <p>
      When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my
      grandparents first brought me to their home in France and I have now been
      to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning
      experience.

      At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was
      eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons,
      then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw
      the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great
      Wall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old stones were still in
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became
      interested in language.

      It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. I
      remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was.
      But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more
      accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.

      In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its
      similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for
      example, is béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same.
      This was incredible to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid,
      and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how
      to say something in Spanish.

      Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied
      Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a
      character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were formed by
      combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山)
      meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means
      volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I
      can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
